# Customer Segmentation project utilizing the K-Means clustering algorithm
This repository contains a Python implementation of customer segmentation, a crucial task in marketing and customer relationship management. By leveraging K-Means clustering, the project aims to group customers into distinct segments based on their shared characteristics and behaviors.

# Overview
Customer segmentation plays a pivotal role in understanding customer preferences, identifying target markets, and tailoring marketing strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and retention. This project utilizes the K-Means clustering algorithm to partition customers into homogeneous groups, enabling businesses to gain actionable insights and personalize their marketing efforts.

# Dataset
The dataset used for customer segmentation comprises various customer attributes and transactional data, such as CustomerID, Gender, Age,	Annual Income, and Spending Score (1-100). These features serve as input variables for the K-Means clustering algorithm, facilitating the identification of meaningful customer segments.

# Model Architecture
K-Means clustering is employed to partition the customer dataset into a predefined number of clusters, with each cluster representing a distinct customer segment. The algorithm iteratively assigns customers to the nearest cluster centroid based on feature similarity, optimizing cluster centroids to minimize the within-cluster variance.

# Usage
1. Data Preparation: Preprocess the customer dataset, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

2. Model Training: Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to the preprocessed dataset, specifying the desired number of clusters based on domain knowledge or using techniques such as the elbow method.

3. Segment Interpretation: Analyze the characteristics and behaviors of customers within each segment to gain actionable insights and formulate targeted marketing strategies.

4. Evaluation: Assess the quality of the customer segmentation by evaluating cluster cohesion and separation, as well as conducting domain-specific validation to ensure the meaningfulness of the segments.

# Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- KMeans
# How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the data, apply K-means clustering, and analyze the resulting customer segments.

Results
The effectiveness of the customer segmentation model is evaluated based on the coherence and distinctiveness of the identified segments, here, we have identified 5 segments or clusters using the elbow method. The results enable businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth.

Contribution
Contributions to improve the model's performance, enhance clustering techniques, or refine segmentation strategies are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
